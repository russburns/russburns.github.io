Thank you for visiting my profile! I am Russ and I am an aspiring aerospace engineer with a passion for the applications and improvement of electric propulsion devices. I am finishing up my 4th year at The College of William & Mary with a BS, Honors in Engineering Physics & Applied Design and a minor in mathematics. Having worn many hats throughout undergrad, I developed an interest in several different fields and activities. I represent my values steadfastly wherever I go, and I am always ready for the next challenge.

A Julia implementation of [Successive Convexification for 6-DoF Mars Rocket Powered Landing with Free-Final-Time](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03827.pdf) by Miki Szmuk and Behçet Açikmeşe. The animation on the left is a planar trajectory and the animation on the right is a recreation of SpaceX's Starship flip maneuver. My code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/govindchari/PTR). Some notes I wrote on PTR can be found [here](/assets/pdf/PTR%20Walkthrough.pdf)

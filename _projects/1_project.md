On December 1st, 2023, electronics youtuber Mitxela uploaded a video about a motion-activated, miniature persistence of vision display that is powered by a flashed R2040-Tiny and a battery. I knew immediately once I saw this video that I had to try and make it. His documentation, which you may find [here](https://mitxela.com/projects/candle), is good in most respects. However, he kept the PCB and circuit diagrams. I then began a meticulous journey into LED matrices, PCB design, MOSFET circuit design, and SMD soldering that offers a far more exciting outcome than anything I've done in class. I have yet to resume construction, but I will finish it one day--or realize that my circuit design is incorrect.

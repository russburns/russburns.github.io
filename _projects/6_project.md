For my first project, I created an extension of the Lake Matoaka dock. I designed the spiraled rods protruding through the dock floor as extensions of foundation piles; this configuration ensures that the dock stays level in the event of floods. For the second project, I designed a house for Sting based along the Nansemond River in Suffolk, Virginia. The colonial influence is clear on the house--but it's almost unavoidable. Brick is able to do so much with so little, and its intrinsic balance between function and form is among the most robust available for building materials. I laid out the site to have space for popup concerts as well.

A bunch of 3D models I did. I first learned blender as part of a Chinese history class; The layout and culture of Qing-era Beijing was thoroughly documented, so we used those primary and secondary sources to recreate parts of the city in Blender and Godot. I modeled a Siheyuan (typical family home) and the interior of its Zhengfang (main room). All furtniture was sculpted by either myself or classmates, and all art is period appropriate (such as the calligraphy). As well, I f a royally-stamped inkstone and the Deshengmen city gate. I haven't done too much since then, but I am currently working on a little bust of myself.
